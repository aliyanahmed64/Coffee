                <h5>Cold Brew Coffee</h5>
                <p>Cold brew coffee is a type of coffee that's brewed with cold water over an extended period, typically
                    12 to 24 hours. Unlike regular coffee, where hot water extracts the flavors quickly, cold brew uses
                    time to pull out the coffee's flavor, resulting in a smooth, rich taste with less acidity. It's
                    often sweeter and less bitter than hot-brewed coffee. The process involves steeping coarsely ground
                    coffee beans in cold or room temperature water and then straining it to create a concentrated coffee
                    base, which can be diluted with milk, water, or a sweetener, depending on preference. It's a popular
                    choice for iced coffee, especially during warmer months, due to its refreshing, mellow flavor and
                    easy-to-drink nature.</p>
